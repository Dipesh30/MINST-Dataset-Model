## Introduction

The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, containing 70,000 images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels, and the dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. This project aims to build and evaluate a model that can accurately classify these handwritten digits.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset can be downloaded from:

- [Yann LeCun's Website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- Or you can use the built-in dataset from popular libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The dataset includes the following:

- **Training Set**: 60,000 images for training
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images for evaluation
- Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is effective for image classification tasks. Key components include:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction from images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: To reduce dimensionality and retain important features.
3. **Flatten Layer**: To convert the 2D matrix into a 1D vector.
4. **Dense Layers**: For final classification.

## Training the Model

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
     git@github.com:Dipesh30/MINST-Dataset-Model.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd mnist-digit-recognition
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
The training process will log accuracy and loss metrics and save the trained model.

Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new handwritten digit images. To test the model, run:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.png
The script will output the predicted digit along with the confidence score.
